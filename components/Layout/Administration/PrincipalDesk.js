I welcome you all to this great institution of higher learning and assure you of a nurturing and caring environment that will see all of you blossom into empowered and sensitive human beings. It is the education and its system that makes the country great, strong and developed. Teacher is a part and parcel component of education system on which all entities depend upon. Teacher does not only make planning of education system but also execute, monitor and evaluate the achievement. Teachers are considered as nation builders .Construction of nation largely depends upon its constructors, so it is a great responsibility of teacher to impart quality education to their students.

                Parents should remember that children should not be forced, but should be guided to achieve whatever goals they may have in their minds in an easy and pleasing manner, so that we may be able to discover the particular touch of genius in each one of them. The purpose of education is to teach our children to think and develop a capacity to reason out facts.

                Students should keep in mind the importance of planning and prioritizing their time and the effective use of it which are essential to achieve success.  They should always think and review – discover the cause and effect of every event, in which they are involved. Do not surrender or become a slave to youthful fancies and indulgences. Be steady in your studies. Learn to enjoy hard work – particularly your studies. Think wisely and systematically. Preserve our heritage and environment for yourself as well as for your next generation.  Always be a soldier to defend and preserve our traditions and our territory. Hard work, dedication and perseverance are the most important traits in a person that lead to success. The future belongs to you and hence develop yourself like a pioneer and ultimately grow as responsible men and women.

                With experienced and dedicated teachers and excellent infrastructure, our college helps students to realize their goals in life.  We encourage all students to take advantage of the opportunities provided by the college and involve themselves in all the extracurricular activities that are offered. The overall development of the mind and body is a sign of a healthy and complete development. As Swami Vivekananda said, “Truth can be stated in a thousand different ways, yet each one can be true.” Your education here, in this college and outside it, during your time here and long after you graduate, will help you find that truth. The true hallmark of that education would be one “by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, the intellect is expanded, and by which one can stand on one’s own feet.” So, seek out that education, discover that truth and remember to use it well. Beckoning new challenges and opportunities, we are marching forward to enhance the quality of this Institution of Excellence.
