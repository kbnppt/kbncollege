		<p className={classes.malPracticeContent}>
			In Respect Of The Internal Assessment Tests Depending Upon The Nature And Gravity Of The Offence The Malpractice Enquiry Committee Can Impose The Punishment
		</p>
		<p className={classes.malPracticeContent}>
			In All Cases, The Candidate Or The Candidates Involved Shall Be Sent Out Of The Hall Forthwith And Kept Out From Writing The Paper On The Day But Before The Candidate Or Candidates Actually Leaves Or Leave Premises, His/Her Or Their Explanation Shall Be Taken In Writing And Forwarded To The Controller Of Examinations Along With The Report Setting Forth In Detail All The Material Evidence. The Address To Which Further Communications Are To Be Made Is To Be Obtained From The Candidate.
		</p>
		<p className={classes.malPracticeContent}>
			In Case The Candidate Refuses To Give A Statement He/She Is Not To Be Forced To Do So, Only The Fact Of Her Refusal Shall Be Reported By Squad Member/Invigilator Duly Endorsed By Chief Superintendent.
		</p>
		<p className={classes.malPracticeContent}>
			It Is Often Complained That Other Candidates In The Hall Have Thrown The Incriminating Material Onto Innocent Candidates Or To Their Nearby Places On Sensing The Approach Of Supervising Staff Or Squad. In Such Cases, The Person Booking The Case Has To Declare If He/She Has Clearly Seen While The Alleged Candidate Is Throwing It Out To Fall Within The Hall Or Outside Or If She Is Suspecting On The Basis Of Tally Of Handwriting Although He/She Could Not Identify Who Has Actually Thrown It Out. In The Case Of Typed/Printed Matter Where It Is Difficult To Establish The Identity Of The Person Responsible For Its Origin, And Also Material Found In The Verandah When The Act Of Throwing Out From The Hall Is Not Clearly Seen, The Benefit Of Doubt Should Be Passed On To The Candidate. However, When The Forbidden Material Is Found In The Desk Or In The Folds Of Answer Book Or Question Paper, Or On The Body Or Clothes Of The Candidate, The Case May Be Processed In The Normal Way, Considering The Concealing Not Amounting To An Act Of Suppression Of Evidence.
		</p>
		<p className={classes.malPracticeContent}>
			Wherever It Is Possible To Send The Articles Carrying The Forbidden Material Eg. Handkerchief, Pad, Hall Ticket Etc., They May Be Produced As Exhibits Before The Committee. The Invigilator/Squad Member Who Detected The Case Shall Give In Writing A Full Description Of The Forbidden Material (Size, Place Where Written Etc) And Countersigned By Chief Superintendent.
		</p>
		<p className={classes.malPracticeContent}>
			The Signature Of The Candidate Shall Also Be Taken On The Transcription Paper Or Papers Describing The Material When Transcription Could Not Be Done. The Chief Superintendent/Squad Member/Invigilator Should Include In His/Her Remarks Why The Transcription Could Not Be Done In Such An Event. If The Committee Comes To The Conclusion Basing On Circumstantial Evidence That A Person Has Resorted To Malpractice Despite Some Procedural Lapses In Reporting By The Concerned Supervising Staff, The Case Is To Be Decided According To The Rules Prescribed Above.
