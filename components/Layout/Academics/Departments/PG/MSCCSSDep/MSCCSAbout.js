            <p>To fully appreciate the scope and organization of computer science at KBN today, it is necessary to understand its history and evolution. Led by a group of visionary enthusiasts the department of MSc (Computer Science) was formed in 2001 with Ms. B.Sowjanya as its head. The intent was simple : a program that would exploit the new technology and assist in firmly establishing a discipline of computer science. Ms .Shamim is currently the head of Department. With 11 years after the inception the growth of CS is taking strides in facilities year after year. Today Information technology has become pervasive, while its parent, Computing Science, has become hard to find. We continue to emphasize the pristine science that lies under the diverse aspects of computing. This is the single most important feature of the education offered here. Over the years we have developed a distinctive style and method that bridges the theory- practice divide while remaining grounded in the core. We want the education imparted to the students to be the basis of life time of learning.</p>
            <h2>GOALS OF THE PROGRAM</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintain up-to-date knowledge of the evolving computer science landscape.</li>
                <li>Develop faculty expertise in emerging areas of the computing sciences, such as cloud computing or mobile computing, and encourage interdisciplinary scholarship by students and faculty.</li>
                <li>Support and encourage faculty participation at conferences and meetings to facilitate scholarly productivity and professional development</li>
                <li>Provide more opportunities for faculty, students and alumni to interact and network together in informal settings.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAM</h2>
