            <p className={classes.teluguContent}>
                <b>Taxonomist:</b> Taxonomists organize species of plants into categories, after studying individual plants and grouping their species together based on similarities. A lot the species that they identify are representative of the established evolutionary relationships of plant groups.
            </p>
            <p className={classes.teluguContent}>
                <b>Agronomist: </b> These are soil and plant scientists who work to improve the yield of field crops like grains and cotton. They develop processes that assist farmers in growing more crops and preventing disease in them.
