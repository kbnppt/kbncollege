          Community Outreach is an important part to engage faculty and students
          in meaningful service activities that enrich their learning and
          enhance the quality of life for others in our communities. KBN college
          is located in I town area where there is space constriction due to
          business organisations. Most of the schools have limited space to
          train their students in games and sports. As KBN College is having
          enough space for games and separate courts for Basket Ball, Throw
          Ball, Shuttle Badminton, Table Tennis etc. the Physical Education
          Department with the help of College Management is conducting Outreach
          programs every year in summer to nearby School children in initiating
          a spirit of enthusiasm in them towards sports. It creates in them the
          zeal to participate in sports which helps to develop in them team
          spirit, Leadership qualities and sharing behaviour. The programs are
          conducted in Table Tennis, Basket Ball, Skating, and Chess.
