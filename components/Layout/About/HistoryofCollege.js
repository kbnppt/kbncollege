            <p>Our old town or one town, as it is popularly known, has long been neglected in having educational facilities. There was practically no scope or provision for higher education. Barring one or two High Schools, there was no college in this locality. Young boys and girls, after their high school studies, had to trek long distances to pursue their studies in college, in the two town. Especially the girl students faced many hardships in realizing their dreams of higher education. This urgent need for higher educational facilities strongly compelled some of the philanthropic elite of the business community of this part of the town to put their heads and hands together in working towards the goal.</p>

                Kakaraparti Bhavanarayana College is truly a dream come true for many, especially for those who are residing in the old town of Vijayawada. The long cherished dream has been realized through the benevolence of Danaseela, Purapramukha and Vidya-Poshaka Sri Kakaraparti Bhavanarayana Shresti. The foundation stone of the college was laid on 6th November, 1964 by Sri Kasu Brahmananda Reddy, the then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. The college was constructed on 4.11 acres of land of the S.K.P.V.V. Hindu High Schools’ Committee. It commenced functioning fully ever since July, 1965. The college had a humble beginning with 278 students and a devoted staff of just nineteen under the visionary leadership of the Founder Principal Sri S. Sundaram. The college had taken huge strides in its growth and became one of the premier institutions in Vijayawada, sparing no efforts for the last fifty two years in fulfilling its vision and mission.

The college is also endowed with an elegantly designed open air theatre, Kalanikethan with an open gallery and a seating capacity of 2500, which is one of the spectacular features of the college. Our college emblem symbolizes the noble ideals for which our institution stands. The sunrays, the book and the burning lamp, all represent the divine attributes which aim at dispelling darkness and spreading light. The motto “Thejasvina Vadhitamastu” a part of our daily prayer, truly expresses our pious wish. “Let the Divine Deity help us to carry on our “Adhyayana” that bestows luster on us both.
